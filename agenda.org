CLOSED: [2024-12-23 Mon 23:22]
It's handy to bind =q= key to quit doc window.
But this bind starts working in all =org-mode= buffers.

** TODO Add support for the locally generated docs [3/4]            :feature:
- [X] Add custom enum variable ~rust-docs-source~ to choose priority between docs.rs and local docs. There should be symbol values ~web~ and ~local~.
- [ ] Write function to generate docs with ~cargo doc~ if they wasn't found
- [X] Abstract part of the [[file:rust-docs.el::(defun rust-docs--search-crate][rust-docs--search-crate]] to fetch from the local ~target/doc~ directory if ~rust-docs-source~ equals to ~local~.
- [X] Abstract part of the [[file:rust-docs.el::(defun rust-docs-search-entry][rust-docs-search-entry]] to fetch from the local ~taget/doc/crate~ directory if ~rust-docs-source~ equals to ~local~.

** TODO Add suport for absolute urls in doc links                       :bug:
